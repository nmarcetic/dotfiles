# My Dotfiles live here.
Public repository contains my personal dotfiles.
No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system,  I can replicate my configuration easily on new installation.
Setup, structure and automation is inspired by [Nicola's Paolucci blog post](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/)
